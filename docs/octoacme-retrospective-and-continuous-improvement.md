# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

### Cross-functional Retrospective Participation
- **Support Lead**: Shares customer feedback, recurring support issues, and insights on how releases impacted customer satisfaction.
- **Technical Writer**: Provides feedback on documentation gaps, clarity issues reported by users, and suggestions for improving documentation processes.

## Tracking Improvements

- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
