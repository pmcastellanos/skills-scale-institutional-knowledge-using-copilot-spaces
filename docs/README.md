# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation hub. This README provides an overview of our project management philosophy, key practices, and quick links to detailed process documentation.

## OctoAcme Project Management Philosophy

OctoAcme follows a **customer-first, iterative delivery approach** that emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Our methodology is designed to help teams deliver value efficiently while maintaining quality and transparency throughout the project lifecycle.

### Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to enable faster feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

## Project Lifecycle Overview

OctoAcme projects follow a structured five-phase lifecycle:

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, and establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies, and create release plans
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate with regular team sync-ups
4. **Release**: Deploy to production with comprehensive testing and rollback plans
5. **Retrospective**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements

## Key Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, manages schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **UX Designer**: Creates intuitive user experiences through research and design
- **DevOps/SRE Engineer**: Ensures reliable infrastructure, deployments, and system observability
- **Technical Writer**: Creates clear documentation for users and developers
- **Business Analyst**: Bridges business needs with technical solutions and validates requirements
- **Support Lead**: Manages customer support and provides customer feedback insights
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

## Key Artifacts

Throughout the project lifecycle, teams create and maintain essential artifacts:

- **Project Charter / One-pager**: Problem statement, goals, and success metrics
- **Roadmap and Release Plan**: Timeline and milestone mapping
- **Sprint/Iteration Backlog**: Prioritized work items with acceptance criteria
- **Risk Register**: Tracked risks with mitigation plans
- **Retrospective Notes**: Learnings and action items for continuous improvement

## Communication Cadence

- **Daily standups**: 15-minute team sync focusing on progress and blockers
- **Weekly sync**: PM + PdM alignment on progress and risks
- **Twice-weekly standups**: For delivery teams (or as agreed)
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: Progress reports and milestone reviews
- **Ad-hoc escalations**: As needed for critical issues
