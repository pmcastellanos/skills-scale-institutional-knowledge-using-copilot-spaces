# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map

### Cross-functional Planning Interactions
- **Business Analyst**: Validates requirements, clarifies acceptance criteria, and ensures backlog items align with business objectives.
- **UX Designer**: Reviews user-facing features for design needs, creates wireframes/mockups, and ensures design work is sequenced appropriately in the backlog.
- **Technical Writer**: Identifies documentation needs for new features and ensures documentation tasks are included in the release plan.

## Backlog Item Template
- Title:
- Description:
- Acceptance criteria:
- Priority:

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
- Ensure team capacity is respected

## Risk & Dependency Management
- Capture in Risk Register:
  - ID, Description, Impact, Probability, Owner, Mitigation
- Mark cross-team dependencies in the project board and escalate during weekly syncs
